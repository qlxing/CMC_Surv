During pretraining, both intact and masked versions of each modality are input
into their respective branches. In the multi-modal completion process, the masked
modality integrates features from the intact version of the other modality, which are
then passed into the decoder for reconstruction. In the visual decoder, a learnable mask
token is used, while in the graph transformer decoder, clinical variable-specific features
from the encoder serve as masked tokens.

## Code
ðŸš§ The complete codebase is currently being reconstructed and will be uploaded progressively.

We appreciate your patience and interest!
